# Weddings

## What We Know

- Chapel seats 200+
- All-inclusive packages offered
- Conversion is exceptionally high when Uncle Michael runs scheduled demos
- The problem isn't closing—it's everything around it
- Driving more inquiries without tightening the demo-to-close steps risks creating more busywork and missed follow-up

## How It Works

[To be filled during engagement]

**Lead sources:** [UNKNOWN]

**Inquiry → Close path:**
- Website inquiry form → Calendly → Agile CRM → [fragmented] → Payment
- Path from inquiry to follow-up to paperwork to payment is fragmented
- Creates leakage, slows conversion

**Who's involved:**
- Uncle Michael: runs scheduled demos (exceptionally high conversion)
- Wedding coordinator (legacy): exiting. Elena/Ayra covering interim. Hiring replacement.

## The Walkthrough-to-Payment Opportunity

A clean walkthrough-to-payment workflow is a high-ROI lever because it removes friction in a channel with a high close rate. It becomes more justified as soon as any incremental revenue (even from catering) increases operational load, since these systems are interconnected.

It may also be worth pursuing early in a lightweight form as a proof of capability: a fast, custom improvement that demonstrates how targeted solutions can convert directly into throughput.

## Friction Points

1. Inquiry-to-close path is fragmented (follow-up, paperwork, payment)
2. Wedding coordinator transition in progress—Elena/Ayra interim, hiring for dedicated coordinator
3. Can't push more volume until friction is removed—otherwise creates busywork and missed opportunities

## Gaps to Fill

- Current packages and pricing
- Contracts, deposits, payment tooling
- Where deals stall
- Handoff points (previously Uncle Michael → coordinator, now TBD pending new hire)

## Status

Secondary focus. Conversion is already high—the problem is everything around it. Fix the close path friction first, then drive more inquiries.
