*Chronological record. Append-only. What happened, when. Never edited after entry.*

## Entry 1 — Intake Answers (Q1–Q5)

**Received:** Initial intake

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Silver Sycamore is a family-owned property in Pasadena, TX, acquired January 2025
- Six-acre western-themed venue ("Sycamoreville") with chapel, restaurant, B&B, event spaces
- Michael (operator) and Don (financial oversight via Peterson CPA) are primary stakeholders
- Core constraint is revenue—all work must tie to making money or protecting it
- Primary focus: catering sales (most reliable near-term path)
- Secondary focus: weddings (high conversion, but needs friction removed first)
- Legacy staff from prior ownership includes wedding coordinator (capable, friction on process) and marketing director (Michael wants to cut)
- Systems: Website → Calendly → Agile CRM → [fragmented] → Payment
- Michael wants to use slow months (Jan/Feb) to get SOPs in order

**Gaps identified:**
- CRM options and criteria
- Marketing director contracts/obligations
- Catering details (menu, pricing, packages, leads)
- Close path details (where deals stall)

## Entry 2 — Research Run

**Received:** Research on Silver Sycamore public presence, industry structure, catering workflows

**Summary:**
- Confirmed property details, directory listings, review ratings
- Pine Street Cafe strong (4.4/5), B&B weak (3.0/5)
- Found legacy ownership references (Jackie) and staff names (outdated)
- Pricing and package info from directories is unverified, may be outdated
- Extracted industry benchmarks for reference
- Identified legacy friction patterns from reviews (unvalidated for current ownership)

**Key insight:** Research reflects prior ownership. Most specifics need validation with Michael.

## Entry 3 — Wedding Coordinator Exit

**Received:** Update from Derek

**Summary:**
Wedding coordinator (legacy staff) put in her two weeks notice today. She's exiting.

**Implications:**
- Removes the direction/process friction that existed with her
- Opens question: who handles wedding coordination going forward?
- Transition timing confirmed—staff changes are now happening

## Entry 4 — People Artifact + Motivation Intel

**Received:** Update from Derek

**Summary:**
- Created dedicated people artifact to track roles, duties, ownership, motivations
- Key insight: Michael, Elaynah, and Aura all view Silver Sycamore as a place they can retire. They want to grow it into something. Commitment and motivation from Elaynah and Aura is very high.
- Spelling note: Elaynah (not Alaina)

**Implications:**
- Core team is invested long-term, not just working a job
- High motivation means they'll engage with process improvements, not resist them
- Building out their roles and ownership is worth the investment

## Entry 5 — Workflow Framework Established

**Received:** Session discussion

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Established command center artifact as session entry point
- Clarified artifact roles: engagement log (chronological, frozen) vs. notes-ideas (parking lot, malleable)
- Defined working relationship: Derek talks fluidly, Claude sorts into appropriate artifacts
- Command center gets updated at session close to reflect current state

**Implications:**
- Clear entry point for every session
- Fluid intake without losing information
- Artifacts have distinct, non-overlapping purposes

## Entry 6 — Full Artifact Restructure

**Received:** Session discussion

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Red-teamed entire artifact set from first principles
- Consolidated 13 artifacts → 10 artifacts
- Merged current-understanding into business-map (single source for business context)
- Consolidated 4 inactive channel docs (restaurant, bnb, corporate-events, special-events) → other-channels.md
- Created system-flow.html as rendered diagram of information routing
- Redesigned command-center as scannable dashboard with Session Scratch container
- Established manual session invocation ("new session" / "start session" to begin, "wrap up" / "close session" to end)
- Defined explicit routing rules: conversation → Claude sorts → artifacts → command center aggregates

**Final artifact set (10):**
1. command-center.md — dashboard, entry point
2. system-flow.html — routing diagram
3. engagement-log.md — chronological history
4. notes-ideas.md — parking lot
5. engagement-tracker.md — decisions/wins
6. business-map.md — business context
7. people.md — roles/duties
8. catering.md — primary channel
9. weddings.md — secondary channel
10. other-channels.md — consolidated inactive

**Implications:**
- Minimal artifact set with maximum coverage
- All artifacts connected via explicit routing
- Session boundaries manually controlled
- System flow diagram chronicles routing logic

## Entry 7 — Transition Plans Clarified

**Received:** Session update

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Wedding coordination: Elaynah and Aura handling interim. Active hiring for dedicated coordinator. Structure allows assistant coordinators to branch out by event type as business grows.
- Marketing director: Function to be replaced by automation system (n8n + generative AI), not redistributed as workload. Derek builds system, hands keys to stakeholder who directs it. Salary redistributed to Elaynah/Aura. Michael aware of general direction but not fully briefed on technical approach.
- Marketing automation added as deliverable — time-sensitive, needs to be ready before marketing director exits.

**Implications:**
- Wedding coordination no longer blocked — plan in motion
- Marketing automation is a technical build Derek owns
- Need to document marketing director's current duties/contracts before exit

## Entry 7 — Intelligence vs Directive Separation

**Received:** Session discussion

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Identified gap: artifacts were conflating strategic assessment with directives/decisions
- "Catering is primary focus" was written as decision, but it's actually a working hypothesis
- Operations and workflows are archaic — may require attention before or alongside revenue work
- Sequencing is not yet decided — pending operational assessment
- Adjusted artifacts to distinguish intelligence (what we've assessed) from directives (what we've decided)

**Changes made:**
- command-center: Phase changed to evaluation mode, next actions include operational assessment
- engagement-tracker: Separated "Decisions" from new "Working Hypotheses" section
- business-map: Changed "Priority" column to "Assessment," softened language
- catering.md: Reframed opening as strategic case, not decided focus

**Implications:**
- Artifacts now properly reflect that we're in evaluation mode
- Hypotheses can evolve without contradicting "decisions"
- Operational assessment is explicitly on the table
- Maintains agnosticism on sequencing until directive is made

## Entry 8 — Ownership Structure Clarified

**Received:** Session update

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Peterson CPA (Friendswood) is owned by Uncle Don, John Peterson, and Joe Peterson
- Peterson CPA is the entity that purchased and owns Silver Sycamore
- Commitment level from Petersons is 100%
- Uncle Don, John, Joe, and Uncle Michael act as board of directors
- Naming convention established: use "Uncle Don" and "Uncle Michael" in documentation (informal but preferred)

**Implications:**
- Ownership structure is clearer — Peterson CPA is the actual owner, not just financial oversight
- Board structure now documented
- All artifacts updated to use Uncle Michael/Uncle Don naming convention

---

## Entry 9 — Translation Layer Protocol Established

**Received:** Session discussion

**Source:** Derek

**Summary:**
- Identified need for explicit protocol to convert external inputs into structured engagement artifacts
- Defined translation layer stages: Intake → Inventory → Extract → Map → Transform → Stage → Commit
- Staging step requires explicit surfacing of proposed changes and ambiguity before commit
- Commit only after approval — maintains fidelity and prevents false structure

**Changes made:**
- Command center restructured: Session Scratch now under "Pending" container alongside "Staged Changes"
- Added Project Files Index section to command center — tracks company docs, checked at session start for sync
- Project instructions updated with translation layer protocol

**Implications:**
- System now optimized for bulk document ingestion (preparing for tomorrow's session with Uncle Michael)
- Clear bridge between project files (company docs) and engagement artifacts
- External inputs go through defined translation process rather than direct fire-hose
- Artifacts stay at 10 — no structural change, just protocol upgrade
