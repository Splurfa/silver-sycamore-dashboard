# Catering

## Strategic Case for Prioritization

*This is a working hypothesis, not a directive. Subject to change based on operational assessment.*

Catering may be the most reliable near-term path to revenue:
- Shorter sales cycle than weddings
- Can generate income during slow season (Jan/Feb) while team builds capacity
- Weddings are high-value but have longer cycle and may require friction removal first

**Status:** Under evaluation. Sequencing not yet decided.

## What We Know

- Listed as core offering on website
- Pine Street Cafe provides in-house catering capability
- Research found reference to serving 300 guests at an off-site event in under 25 minutes (legacy ownership, unverified)

## How It Works

**Lead sources:** [UNKNOWN]

**Inquiry → Close path:** [UNKNOWN]

**Who's involved:** [UNKNOWN]

## Menu, Pricing & Packages

## Volume & Revenue

[UNKNOWN]

## Friction Points

[Need to map the current process first]

## Gaps to Fill

- Current menu, pricing, packages
- Where leads come from now
- The actual close path: inquiry → quote → contract → deposit → delivery
- Where deals stall or leak
- Who owns this end-to-end

## What's Needed

**Sales-ready presence:** Clearer website + catering positioning so prospects understand what's offered.

**Catering materials:** Menu/offer structure + the basic deliverables that make quoting and closing simple. Without these, every inquiry requires custom work.

**Lead workflow:** Prospect list → outreach → follow-up → clean handoff to the on-site team for conversion. Without a defined path, leads leak.

## Status

Leading candidate for primary focus. Pending operational assessment and sequencing decision.
