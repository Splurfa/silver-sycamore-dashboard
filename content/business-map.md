# Business Map

*Single source for business context. Structure, systems, money flow, constraints.*

## The Engagement

Derek is family. Business operations consultant who came to visit knowing they'd acquired the business and that he could help.

Partner: senior developer (15 years) with strong product/systems experience, currently focused on AI primitives. Involvement level TBD.

This isn't traditional consulting — it's family helping family, with a real business that needs to make more money.

## Revenue Channels

| Channel | Status | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Catering | Active. Details unknown. | Leading candidate — short cycle, slow-season potential |
| Weddings | Active. High conversion on demos. Friction in close path. | High value, but may need friction removal first |
| Restaurant (Pine Street Cafe) | Active. Strong reviews. | Operating — not prioritized |
| Corporate Events | Listed. Details unknown. | Not prioritized |
| Special Events | Listed. Undefined. | Not prioritized |
| B&B | Active. Underperforming. | Not prioritized |

**Working assessment (not yet directive):**
- Catering appears most reliable for near-term revenue — can generate income during slow season while team builds capacity
- Weddings have high conversion but friction around close path may need addressing first
- Operations/workflows are archaic — may require attention before or alongside revenue work
- Sequencing not yet decided — pending operational assessment

## The People

See **people.md** for full detail on roles, duties, ownership, motivations.

**Ownership:** Peterson CPA (Friendswood) — Uncle Don, John Peterson, Joe Peterson. Firm purchased and owns Silver Sycamore. Act as board of directors with Uncle Michael.

**Core team:** Uncle Michael (operator, board), Elaynah (core staff), Aura (core staff)
Uncle Michael and core team view Silver Sycamore as a place they can retire. Commitment is high.

**Operations support:** Derek (business operations consultant, family)

**Legacy staff:**
- Wedding coordinator — exiting (two weeks notice). Hiring replacement; Elaynah/Aura covering interim.
- Marketing director — exiting (timing TBD). Function to be replaced by automation system, not redistributed as workload.

*Transition:* Owners avoided major staff changes for ~1 year post-acquisition due to inherited bookings and continuity obligations. That period is ending — staffing, role clarity, and process changes are now on the table.

## Systems

**Current flow:** Website inquiry form → Calendly → Agile CRM → [gap] → Payment

- Path from inquiry to follow-up to paperwork to payment is fragmented
- Creates leakage, slows conversion
- CRM: Agile CRM in use. Considering a new CRM (name pending). Non-negotiable: API access + data portability.

**Why process matters now:** Process, documentation, and workflows affect how fast and reliably the team can sell, follow up, and deliver. These systems are interconnected — improvements compound.

**Walkthrough-to-payment workflow:** High-ROI lever because it removes friction in a channel with high close rate. Becomes more justified as incremental revenue increases operational load. May be worth pursuing early in lightweight form as proof of capability.

---

## The Core Constraint

**Revenue.** The business needs to make more money.

Spend must either:
- Drive immediate revenue
- Protect existing revenue
- Show very high ROI on a specific deliverable

If it doesn't pay off fast, we're not doing it.

This shapes everything:
- Process and documentation matter because they affect sell/follow-up/deliver speed
- SOPs matter because Uncle Michael wants to use Jan/Feb (slow season) to get them in order

---

## Uncle Michael's Vision

Wants the property to feel like a true destination:
- Stronger use of full footprint
- Clearer zones and areas
- Experiential additions (e.g., beer garden)

Reference point: Knott's Berry Farm's Old West area — orientation-driven map ("you are here"), named zones, guided sense of what to explore.

---

## Gaps That Span Channels

- CRM options under consideration + decision criteria
- Whether marketing cost includes ad spend; any contracts or obligations
- How channels feed each other (if at all)
- Who owns what across the business
