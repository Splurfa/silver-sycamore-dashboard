# Document Version Comparison Report

**Generated:** 2026-01-05
**Purpose:** Compare physical binder documents (photographed 2026-01-05) with Google Drive export (uploaded 2026-01-02)

---

## Executive Summary

**HYPOTHESIS CONFIRMED:** The physical binders contain the **current operational documents** used by staff daily. The Google Drive folder contains **older templates** (primarily 2023-2024 vintage) that serve as digital backups but have not been updated to match current pricing and procedures.

**Key Finding:** Pricing in physical binders is CURRENT. Google Drive templates lack pricing information entirely (they are blank planning templates, not sales documents).

## Version Indicator Analysis

### Date Stamps Found

| Source | Document | Date Indicator | Interpretation |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Google Drive | Bridal Planning Sheet | "2023" in filename | Original version |
| Google Drive | Bridal Planning Sheet | "2024" in filename | Updated version exists |
| Google Drive | Final Appt Form | "2024" in filename | Recent update |
| Google Drive | Valentine's Layout | "2023" in filename | Event-specific, dated |

| Binder | Training Manual | No date visible | Content appears current |
| Binder | Contracts | No visible revision date | Standard legal format |

### Pricing Consistency Check

**Cannot directly compare** - Google Drive contains NO wedding package pricing documents. The Corporate Catering Menu in Google Drive is for a different service (off-premise delivery) and uses different pricing structures.

| Pricing Element | Binder | Google Drive | Match? |
|-----------------|--------|--------------|--------|
| Wedding packages | Present | ABSENT | N/A |
| Shower pricing | Present | ABSENT | N/A |
| Corporate catering (off-premise) | ABSENT | Present | N/A |
| Bar packages | Present ($1175-$1675) | ABSENT | N/A |
| Catering per-person | Present ($25-$44/pp) | Different menu (off-premise) | DIFFERENT PRODUCTS |

## Gap Analysis

### Content in BINDERS Only (Not in Google Drive)
1. All package pricing documentation
2. Legal contracts (Shower, Wedding, Corporate)
3. Booking forms (paper versions)
4. Complete vendor contact list with personal details
5. System login credentials
6. Training manual and schedule
7. Phone sales scripts
8. Equipment inventory references

### Content in GOOGLE DRIVE Only (Not in Binders)
1. Digital Bridal Planning spreadsheets (client-facing)
2. Layout templates for all venue spaces
3. Timeline templates (multiple variations)
4. Month-out planning checklists
5. Corporate/Off-Premise Catering Menu (different product line)
6. Processional/Recessional templates

### Content in BOTH (Different Versions)
1. Vendor lists - Binder more complete; Google Drive has sample entries in planning docs
2. Final appointment checklist - Both have versions

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Digitize binder pricing documents** - Critical gap; no digital backup of current pricing
2. **Archive Google Drive 2023 templates** - Replace with 2024/2025 versions where updated
3. **Verify contract versions** - Ensure binder contracts match any digital versions in use

### Synchronization Needed
| Document | Action | Priority |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Package pricing sheets | Scan/digitize from binder | HIGH |
| Contracts | Verify digital master exists | HIGH |
| Vendor contacts | Merge binder list with digital | MEDIUM |
| Training manual | Create digital version | MEDIUM |
| Bridal Planning sheet | Confirm 2024 version is standard | LOW |

### Source of Truth Designation
| Document Type | Recommended Source of Truth |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Pricing | Physical Binder (until digitized) |
| Contracts | Physical Binder (legal originals) |
| Client planning templates | Google Drive (2024 versions) |
| Room layouts | Google Drive |
| Timeline templates | Google Drive |
| Vendor contacts | Physical Binder (merge to digital) |
| Login credentials | Physical Binder (security) |

---

## Conclusion

The hypothesis is **CONFIRMED**: Physical binders are the current operational source for pricing, contracts, and sales materials. Google Drive serves as a repository for client-facing planning templates but lacks critical pricing and legal documents.

**Critical Risk Identified:** No digital backup of current pricing exists. If the physical binder is lost or damaged, pricing information would need to be reconstructed.

**Next Step:** Prioritize digitization of all pricing documents from Binder 2 (IMG_0440-0451) to create authoritative digital versions.
