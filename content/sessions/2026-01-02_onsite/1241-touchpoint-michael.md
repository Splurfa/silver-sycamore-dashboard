## Catering Infrastructure

**Current:** Runs through **Easy Cater** (10-15% fee). Orders flow to Silver Sycamore.

**Immediate:** Stabilize Easy Cater — ensure it's live and processing payments reliably.

**Future:** Migrate catering to **Square** for unified commerce. Pine Street Cafe already on Square. Catering menu exists but not yet connected.

## Staff Roles (New Intel)

| Person | Function | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Krista | Wedding coordination, bridal tracker, day-of contact | Likely the exiting coordinator — role description matches |
| Aura & Elaynah | Sales outreach, tours, walk-in conversion, CRM entry/follow-up | Confirms core team duties (previously TBD) |
| Aubrey | Holds website/system logins | New — will walk Derek through access |

## Systems

**Domains:**
- silversycamore.com
- pinestreetcafe.square.site (Square)

**Stack:** Calendly, Google Calendar, disconnected booking/comms. Fragmented experience.

## Sales Enablement

**Revenue context:** $200K+ catering target discussed (aspirational framing).

**Dual-mode preference:**
- Personal contact for upsells, customization, relationships
- Self-service for repeat/simple orders

## Technical Direction

Modular builds — one high-leverage module at a time (catering first). Shared data backbone. Incremental, not overhaul.

## Immediate Actions

1. Stabilize Easy Cater payments
2. Access handoff — Easy Cater, silversycamore.com admin, Square backend
3. Meet with Aubrey — review access and current barriers
4. Map processes/tools/friction → prioritized roadmap

## To Clarify

- Aubrey's actual role (marketing director? separate?)
- Confirm Krista = exiting wedding coordinator
