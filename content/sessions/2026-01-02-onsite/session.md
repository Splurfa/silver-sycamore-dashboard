# Session Log: 2026-01-02 (Onsite)

## Status

active

## Session Summary

First on-site session with Uncle Michael at Silver Sycamore. Gathered comprehensive operational details including current tech stack (Easy Cater, Square, Calendly, Agile CRM, Constant Contact), staff roles and responsibilities, and active initiatives. Key strategic insight: Easy Cater is working and generating revenue — stabilize before expanding. Technical work should be discrete modular builds, not monolithic systems.

## Key Learnings

- Easy Cater is the primary revenue channel — stabilize, don't reinvent
- Modular builds preferred over monolithic integrated projects
- Staff (Aura, Elaynah) handle both events and sales calls
- Krista confirmed as wedding coordinator name; Aubrey supports weddings
- 4 active initiatives in flight: Square migration, Easy Cater stabilization, wedding coordinator hiring, marketing automation

## Open Questions

- What are the current friction points in Easy Cater workflow?
- How is Square migration progressing?
- What does the marketing director's current contract look like?
- What menu/pricing documentation exists for catering?
