### Platform Management & Posting Strategy

- **Three-Business Social Media Structure**
  - Restaurant, Venue, and Bed & Breakfast each have separate Facebook accounts
  - Each requires different customer personas and voice/tone approach
  - TikTok managed separately (mobile-only platform with music-driven algorithm)
  - Meta Business Suite used for Facebook/Instagram scheduling (replaced Hootsuite)
    - Real-time posting outperforms scheduled content
    - Platform rewards active engagement during posting sessions
- **Daily Posting Requirements by Platform**
  - Restaurant: 1-2 posts daily (minimum 10/week, target 14/week)
    - Peak engagement: 6-9pm for next-day dining decisions
    - All original photo/video content creation required
    - Different approaches for lunch vs. brunch crowds
  - Venue: 1 post daily, seasonally adjusted
    - Winter: Wedding planning content for summer events
    - Summer: Grounds/ambiance when too hot for ceremonies
  - B&B: 4-5 posts weekly, often cross-promotes restaurant content
  - TikTok: Sporadic posting, music selection critical for reach

### Ad Accounts & Technical Challenges

- **Critical Facebook Ad Account Issue**
  - All current ads tied to departing employee's personal Facebook account
  - Complete campaign shutdown required during transition
  - Must rebuild all ad campaigns from scratch in new business account
  - Historical performance data and optimization will be lost
  - New account setup requires fresh audience building
- **Current Ad Structure to Recreate**
  - Restaurant: $3/day pinned post ad running continuously
  - Venue: Constant lead generation (no lead magnets - poor quality)
  - B&B: Continuous promotion, targets entire US market
  - Lead magnet ads discontinued after attracting "$5,000 wedding" inquiries

### Conversion Tracking

- **Functional Tracking Systems**
  - General website contact form: Google Analytics integration working
  - Phone call tracking: Google conversion attribution enabled
  - Facebook pixel: Properly installed and tracking
  - Landing pages: Separate pages for weddings, corporate, restaurant
- **Broken Tracking Issues**
  - Wedding funnel Calendly widget: Cannot track conversions
  - Lost attribution after prospect reaches scheduling page
  - Google support unable to resolve Calendly integration
  - Manual tracking via "How did you hear about us?" form field
  - Some prospects self-report "Google Ad" or "Facebook ad" as source

### Customer Personas & Voice Strategy

- **Restaurant Customer Segments**
  - Business lunch crowd: Quick, efficient service messaging
  - Brunch crowd: Trendy, experience-focused content
  - Different posting times and content styles for each segment
- **Venue Positioning by Audience**
  - Brides: "Older sister" approach - friendly expert guidance
  - Corporate clients: Professional, assured, experienced positioning
  - Seasonal messaging adjusts based on event planning cycles
- **Voice Differentiation Across Properties**
  - Each business maintains distinct brand voice
  - Customer expectations vary significantly between restaurant/venue/B&B
  - Content strategy adapted to audience sophistication levels

### Event Planning & Operations

- **Seasonal Event Patterns**
  - Winter: Wedding planning season (booking summer events)
  - Summer: Reduced wedding bookings due to heat
  - Planning cycles run 6+ months to 1+ year ahead
  - Posting content aligned with planning seasons vs. event seasons
- **Event Type Focus Areas**
  - Weddings: Primary venue revenue driver
  - Corporate events: Different messaging and positioning required
  - Showers and smaller events: Secondary focus areas
  - Customer qualification important to avoid low-budget inquiries

### Content Creation

- **Original Content Requirements**
  - All restaurant photos/videos created in-house
  - Venue content: Mix of grounds, interiors, event setups
  - B&B content: Room staging, amenities, cross-promotion opportunities
  - TikTok: Video content with strategic music selection
- **Content Planning & Scheduling**
  - Weekly content planning sessions
  - Desktop scheduling for efficiency
  - Mobile posting for optimal algorithm performance
  - Cross-platform content adaptation required
