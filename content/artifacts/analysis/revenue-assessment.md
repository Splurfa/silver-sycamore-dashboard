*Working assessment based on initial discovery. This represents our evaluation of each channel's potential and priority.*

## Channel Priority Matrix

| Channel | Status | Our Assessment | Priority |
|---------|--------|----------------|----------|
| Catering | Active | Leading candidate — short cycle, slow-season potential | **HIGH** |
| Weddings | Active | High value, high conversion, but friction in close path | **HIGH** |
| Restaurant (Pine Street Cafe) | Active | Operating well, strong reviews, not revenue bottleneck | Low |
| Corporate Events | Listed | Details unknown, undefined opportunity | Low |
| Special Events | Listed | Undefined category, needs scoping | Low |
| B&B | Active | Underperforming (3.0/5 reviews, missing Airbnb) | Medium |

## Catering Channel Analysis

**Why we think this is high-priority:**
- Short sales cycle (compared to weddings)
- Can generate revenue during slow season (Jan/Feb)
- Team can build capacity while booking steady catering work
- Less operational complexity than weddings

**What we know:**
- Active channel using Easy Cater marketplace
- Details on volume, pricing, margins still unknown

**What we need:**
- Current booking volume and revenue
- Margins and profitability
- Capacity constraints
- Sales process and close rate

**Risk:** We're prioritizing this based on logic (short cycle, slow season fit) but don't have hard data yet.

## Weddings Channel Analysis

**Why this is complex:**
- **High conversion:** Uncle Michael's demos close exceptionally well
- **Friction in path:** Inquiry → follow-up → paperwork → payment is fragmented
- **Staffing transition:** Wedding coordinator exiting, Elaynah/Aura covering

**The strategic question:**
Should we fix the friction first (tighten close path) or drive more volume (marketing/SEO)?

**Our current thinking:**
Driving more inquiries without fixing the friction risks:
- More leakage (lost deals in fragmented handoffs)
- More busywork for team (manual follow-up, chasing paperwork)
- Staff burnout during coordinator transition

**Recommendation:** Lightweight automation to tighten demo-to-close before scaling inquiry volume.

**What we need:**
- Current package pricing and structure
- Where deals stall in the process
- Contracts, deposits, payment tooling details

## Restaurant (Pine Street Cafe) Analysis

**Why this is low-priority for revenue work:**
- Already operating
- Strong reviews (4.4/5 TripAdvisor, #10 of 133 Pasadena restaurants)
- Not identified as revenue bottleneck

**Strategic value:**
- Brand awareness and foot traffic
- In-house catering capability for events
- Potential tastings for wedding/event clients
- Cross-sell opportunity (restaurant → venue)

**What we don't know:**
- Actual revenue and margins
- How much it feeds other channels
- Staffing and operational health

**Stance:** Monitor but don't optimize unless data changes the picture.

---

## B&B Channel Analysis

**Current state:**
- Active but underperforming
- Weak reviews (3.0/5 TripAdvisor, 12 reviews)
- Missing from Airbnb (critical distribution gap)
- Unclear occupancy and management

**Why it's underperforming (our hypothesis):**
1. Not on Airbnb (largest lodging platform)
2. Poor reviews suggest service/quality issues
3. May lack clear value proposition

**Potential:**
- Multi-day wedding packages (bride + family stay on-site)
- Corporate retreat lodging
- Destination experience (Old West theme + restaurant)

**What it needs:**
1. **Quick win:** List on Airbnb (distribution)
2. **Harder fix:** Improve guest experience to fix reviews
3. **Strategic:** Package with weddings/events

**Priority:** Medium — quick wins available (Airbnb) but core issues may need operational attention.

---

## Corporate Events & Special Events

**Status:** Listed on website, details completely unknown.

**What "Special Events" might mean:**
- Birthdays, quinceañeras, reunions, holiday parties
- Could be catch-all for non-wedding social events

**Why we can't assess:**
- No data on volume, pricing, or typical clients
- Unclear who handles these bookings
- No sense of demand or profitability

**Recommendation:** Gather basic data (bookings in last 12 months, revenue, who manages) before assessing priority.

## Working Strategy (Not Yet Directive)

**Our current thinking:**

1. **Catering** appears most reliable for near-term revenue:
   - Can generate income during slow season
   - Builds team capacity and confidence
   - Short cycle = faster feedback loop

2. **Weddings** have high conversion but may need friction removal first:
   - Tighten demo-to-close workflow
   - Lightweight automation for follow-up/paperwork/payment
   - Prove value before scaling inquiry volume

3. **Operations/workflows** are archaic across channels:
   - May require attention before or alongside revenue work
   - Process improvements compound across channels
   - Uncle Michael wants to use Jan/Feb for SOP work

**Sequencing not yet decided** — pending operational assessment and data gathering.

**What changes this:**
- Hard revenue/margin data by channel
- Operational capacity assessment
- Uncle Michael's priority input after he sees options

---

## Cross-Channel Opportunities

**Gaps we've identified:**
- How channels feed each other (restaurant → venue bookings?)
- Whether marketing spend is integrated or siloed
- Who owns revenue responsibility for each channel
- Potential for bundled packages (B&B + wedding, catering + corporate event)

**Hypothesis:** Channels are currently operating independently. Integration/cross-sell could unlock value without new customer acquisition.

---

## Revenue Constraint Framing

**The Core Constraint:** Revenue. The business needs to make more money.

**What this means for channel strategy:**
- Spend must drive immediate revenue, protect existing revenue, or show very high ROI
- We can't do long-term brand building or speculative projects
- Every dollar and hour must pay off fast

**How this shapes priorities:**
- Short-cycle channels (catering) over long-cycle (weddings)
- Quick wins (website forms, Airbnb listing) over infrastructure
- Friction removal (close path) over volume generation (SEO, ads)
- Proven channels over experimental ones
