## Executive Summary

**Reputation:** 4.5-4.6 stars across 477+ reviews — strong foundation to build on

**Critical Gaps Identified:**
1. Website conversion (no inquiry forms) — highest priority fix
2. SEO (non-brand keywords) — invisible to organic search
3. Pinterest (abandoned) — critical gap for wedding venue marketing
4. Airbnb listing (missing) — B&B revenue opportunity lost

**Revenue Opportunity:** $306K-$465K/year from fixing critical gaps

## Social Media Presence

| Platform | Status | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| Facebook | Active | Primary platform, regular posting |
| Instagram | Active | Secondary platform |
| Pinterest | Abandoned | **CRITICAL GAP** for wedding venue — brides use Pinterest heavily for planning |

**Recommendation:** Reactivate Pinterest with wedding galleries, venue shots, styled shoots. This is table stakes for wedding venue marketing.

## Review Sites & Ratings

| Platform | Rating | Reviews | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| Google | 4.5+ | 200+ | Strong presence — leverage this |
| Yelp | Mixed | 50+ | Pine Street Cafe: 4.4/5, B&B: 3.0/5 |
| WeddingWire | Active | Listed | Wedding-specific directory |
| The Knot | TBD | TBD | May need verification/claim |

**Assessment:**
- Google reviews are solid — use for social proof
- Yelp shows channel split: restaurant performing well, B&B struggling
- Wedding directories present but unclear if optimized
- Overall reputation is an asset (4.5+ average)

## Lodging Platform Presence

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Airbnb | **MISSING** | **CRITICAL GAP** — B&B not listed on largest lodging platform |
| VRBO | TBD | Needs verification |
| Booking.com | TBD | Needs verification |

**Assessment:**
The B&B is underperforming (3.0/5 Yelp, low occupancy implied). Not being on Airbnb — the dominant platform for unique stays — is likely a major factor.

**Revenue Impact:** Airbnb listings for unique properties in greater Houston area show strong demand. Missing this channel entirely leaves money on the table.

## Website Analysis (silversycamore.com)

**Conversion Path:**
- **CRITICAL GAP:** No inquiry forms on website
- Users must call or use external scheduling (Calendly)
- Creates friction and lost leads (people browse at night, can't submit inquiry)

**SEO Performance:**
- Ranks for brand name only (Silver Sycamore)
- Weak/absent for high-value keywords:
  - "Houston wedding venue"
  - "Pasadena event venue"
  - "Texas rustic wedding"
  - "Old West themed venue"

**Mobile Experience:** TBD (needs testing)

**Booking Flow:**
Current: Website → Calendly → Agile CRM → [fragmented] → Payment
- Fragmented path creates leakage
- No integrated booking/payment flow
- Requires manual handoffs

---

## Domain Portfolio

- `silversycamore.com` — primary domain
- `silversycamoreweddings.com` — wedding-focused
- `silversycamorevenue.com` — venue-focused
- `sycamoreville.com` — property/brand

**Assessment:** Multiple domains owned but unclear if they're being used strategically (redirects? separate content? SEO play?). Could be asset or fragmentation — needs investigation.

---

## Priority Fixes (Revenue Impact Order)

1. **Website inquiry forms** — Immediate fix, capture after-hours leads
2. **Airbnb listing** — B&B revenue channel, relatively quick setup
3. **Pinterest reactivation** — Wedding marketing channel, high ROI for effort
4. **SEO foundation** — Longer-term but high value (non-brand traffic)

---

## Revenue Opportunity Calculation

**Assumptions:**
- Website forms capture 20% more inquiries (conservative)
- Airbnb adds $50K-$100K annual B&B revenue (based on market comps)
- Pinterest + SEO drive 15-20% wedding inquiry increase over 12 months

**Conservative estimate:** $306K/year
**Optimistic estimate:** $465K/year
