## The Engagement

Derek is family. Business operations consultant who came to visit knowing they'd acquired the business and that he could help.

Partner: senior developer (15 years) with strong product/systems experience, currently focused on AI primitives. Involvement level TBD.

This isn't traditional consulting — it's family helping family, with a real business that needs to make more money.

## The People

See **people.md** for full detail on roles, duties, ownership, motivations.

**Ownership:** Peterson CPA (Friendswood) — Uncle Don, John Peterson, Joe Peterson. Firm purchased and owns Silver Sycamore. Act as board of directors with Uncle Michael.

**Core team:** Uncle Michael (operator, board), Elaynah (core staff), Aura (core staff)
Uncle Michael and core team view Silver Sycamore as a place they can retire. Commitment is high.

**Operations support:** Derek (business operations consultant, family)

**Legacy staff:**
- Wedding coordinator — exiting (two weeks notice). Hiring replacement; Elaynah/Aura covering interim.
- Marketing director — exiting (timing TBD). Function to be replaced by automation system, not redistributed as workload.

*Transition:* Owners avoided major staff changes for ~1 year post-acquisition due to inherited bookings and continuity obligations. That period is ending — staffing, role clarity, and process changes are now on the table.

## Systems

**Current flow:** Website inquiry form → Calendly → Agile CRM → [gap] → Payment

- Path from inquiry to follow-up to paperwork to payment is fragmented
- Creates leakage, slows conversion
- CRM: Agile CRM in use. Considering a new CRM (name pending). Non-negotiable: API access + data portability.

**Why process matters now:** Process, documentation, and workflows affect how fast and reliably the team can sell, follow up, and deliver. These systems are interconnected — improvements compound.

**Walkthrough-to-payment workflow:** High-ROI lever because it removes friction in a channel with high close rate. Becomes more justified as incremental revenue increases operational load. May be worth pursuing early in lightweight form as proof of capability.

### Current Stack

| System | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Easy Cater | Catering marketplace + lead source | Active — primary catering channel |
| Square | POS, payments, invoicing | Active — expanding to replace separate invoicing |
| Calendly | Scheduling | Active |
| Agile CRM | Lead tracking | Active — considering replacement |
| Constant Contact | Email marketing | Active |

### Domains

- `silversycamore.com` — primary domain
- `silversycamoreweddings.com` — wedding-focused
- `silversycamorevenue.com` — venue-focused
- `sycamoreville.com` — property/brand

## The Core Constraint

**Revenue.** The business needs to make more money.

Spend must either:
- Drive immediate revenue
- Protect existing revenue
- Show very high ROI on a specific deliverable

If it doesn't pay off fast, we're not doing it.

This shapes everything:
- Process and documentation matter because they affect sell/follow-up/deliver speed
- SOPs matter because Uncle Michael wants to use Jan/Feb (slow season) to get them in order

---

## Uncle Michael's Vision

Wants the property to feel like a true destination:
- Stronger use of full footprint
- Clearer zones and areas
- Experiential additions (e.g., beer garden)

Reference point: Knott's Berry Farm's Old West area — orientation-driven map ("you are here"), named zones, guided sense of what to explore.

## Michael's Sales & Partner Vision

*Observed 2026-01-02 from bulletin board in Michael's office. Confidence: 0.85 [++++]*

**Sales Tactics:**
- Calculate LTV per department (know what customers are worth)
- Train staff to always offer extras/add-ons at register
- Use scarcity messaging ("Limited Spots Left")
- Merchandise campaigns (T-Shirt Tuesday)

**Vendor Partner Strategy:**
- Collect "Bonus Cash Cards" (deals/offers) from key vendors
- Build client folders with partner deals for photographers, hair/makeup, florist
- Use partnerships to give clients extra value

---

## Weddings Channel Detail

**What we know:**
- Chapel seats 200+
- All-inclusive packages offered
- Conversion is exceptionally high when Uncle Michael runs scheduled demos
- The problem isn't closing—it's everything around it
- Driving more inquiries without tightening the demo-to-close steps risks creating more busywork and missed follow-up

**Inquiry → Close path:**
- Website inquiry form → Calendly → Agile CRM → [fragmented] → Payment
- Path from inquiry to follow-up to paperwork to payment is fragmented
- Creates leakage, slows conversion

**Who's involved:**
- Uncle Michael: runs scheduled demos (exceptionally high conversion)
- Wedding coordinator (legacy): exiting. Elaynah/Aura covering interim. Hiring replacement.

**Gaps:** Current packages/pricing, contracts/deposits/payment tooling, where deals stall, handoff points

---

## Gaps That Span Channels

- CRM options under consideration + decision criteria
- Whether marketing cost includes ad spend; any contracts or obligations
- How channels feed each other (if at all)
- Who owns what across the business
