# Catering

## Strategic Case for Prioritization

*This is a working hypothesis, not a directive. Subject to change based on operational assessment.*

Catering may be the most reliable near-term path to revenue:
- Shorter sales cycle than weddings
- Can generate income during slow season (Jan/Feb) while team builds capacity
- Weddings are high-value but have longer cycle and may require friction removal first

**Status:** Active. Square catering menu is the priority.

## What We Know

- Listed as core offering on website
- Pine Street Cafe provides in-house catering capability
- Research found reference to serving 300 guests at an off-site event in under 25 minutes (legacy ownership, unverified)

## How It Works

**Lead sources:**
- ~~Easy Cater (deprecated)~~ — marketplace platform, being phased out immediately
- Square catering menu (new primary) — direct-to-customer, matches restaurant model
- Direct inquiries

**Inquiry → Close path:**
- Square menu: customer browses menu → orders → payment via Square
- Direct leads: inquiry → quote → contract → deposit → delivery

**Who's involved:**
- Aura — sales calls, outreach
- Elaynah & Aura — day-of execution

**Revenue context:** Michael mentioned $200K+ revenue target for catering.

**Sales approach (from Michael):** "Outbound, direct, go get it." Not waiting for inbound.

## Square Catering Menu Setup

**Status:** Priority — in progress

**What's needed:**
1. Square login credentials
2. Catering menu content (items, pricing, packages)
3. Create Square site for catering (similar to restaurant menu)
4. Marketing director adds button to main website linking to Square catering menu

**Why this approach:**
- Square already in use for Pine Street Cafe (restaurant) — proven workflow
- Removes marketplace middleman dependency
- Aligns with broader Square migration for invoicing
- Direct-to-customer relationship

## Volume & Revenue

[UNKNOWN]

## Friction Points

[Need to map the current process first]

## Gaps to Fill

- Current menu, pricing, packages
- Where leads come from now
- The actual close path: inquiry → quote → contract → deposit → delivery
- Where deals stall or leak
- Who owns this end-to-end

## What's Needed

**Sales-ready presence:** Clearer website + catering positioning so prospects understand what's offered.

**Catering materials:** Menu/offer structure + the basic deliverables that make quoting and closing simple. Without these, every inquiry requires custom work.

**Lead workflow:** Prospect list → outreach → follow-up → clean handoff to the on-site team for conversion. Without a defined path, leads leak.

## Status

Leading candidate for primary focus. Pending operational assessment and sequencing decision.
