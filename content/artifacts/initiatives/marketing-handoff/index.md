## Notes

### Critical Issues Identified

**Facebook Ad Account Crisis**
- All current ads tied to departing employee's personal Facebook account
- Complete campaign shutdown required during transition
- Must rebuild all ad campaigns from scratch in new business account
- Historical performance data and optimization will be lost
- New account setup requires fresh audience building

**Current Ad Structure to Recreate**
- Restaurant: $3/day pinned post ad running continuously
- Venue: Constant lead generation (no lead magnets - poor quality)
- B&B: Continuous promotion, targets entire US market
- Lead magnet ads discontinued after attracting low-quality inquiries

### Three-Business Social Media Structure

Each property requires different approach:
- **Restaurant**: 1-2 posts daily (minimum 10/week, target 14/week), peak 6-9pm
- **Venue**: 1 post daily, seasonally adjusted (winter = wedding planning content)
- **B&B**: 4-5 posts weekly, cross-promotes restaurant content
- **TikTok**: Sporadic posting, music selection critical for reach

### Platform Details
- Meta Business Suite used for Facebook/Instagram scheduling
- Real-time posting outperforms scheduled content
- Platform rewards active engagement during posting sessions

### Conversion Tracking Status
- Website contact form: Google Analytics working
- Phone call tracking: Google conversion attribution enabled
- Facebook pixel: Properly installed
- **BROKEN**: Wedding funnel Calendly widget cannot track conversions
