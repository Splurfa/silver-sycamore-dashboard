# Ad Account Migration

## Parent
[Marketing Director Handoff](index.md)

## Status
Pending

## MOVE

| MAP | OUTCOME | VERIFY | EXCHANGE |
|-----|---------|--------|----------|
| All current Facebook/Meta ads tied to departing employee's personal account; $3/day restaurant ad, venue lead gen, B&B promotion running | New business-owned Meta Business ad account under company control with all campaigns recreated | Campaigns running at same or better performance levels | No ad spend interruption, no revenue loss during transition |

## Notes

### Current State
- All ads run through personal Facebook account (not business-owned)
- Campaign shutdown required when employee leaves
- Historical data and optimization will be lost
- No backup of current targeting, creative, or performance data

### Required Actions
1. Document current campaigns before shutdown
   - Restaurant: $3/day pinned post specifications
   - Venue: Lead generation campaign settings
   - B&B: US-wide targeting parameters
2. Set up new Meta Business account under company ownership
3. Recreate all campaigns from scratch
4. Build fresh audiences (optimization reset)

### Risk
High - Direct revenue impact if ads go dark during transition
