## Decisions

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| All spend must tie to revenue | Core constraint is revenue. Spend must drive immediate revenue, protect existing revenue, or show very high ROI. If it doesn't pay off fast, we're not doing it. |
| Modular builds, not monolithic systems | Technical work should be discrete, stackable pieces — not large integrated projects. Each piece delivers value independently. Avoids scope creep and allows rapid iteration. |

## Working Hypotheses

*Strategic assessments — not yet directives. Subject to change based on operational evaluation.*

| Hypothesis | Basis | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| Catering is likely highest-leverage for near-term revenue | Can generate income during slow season (Jan/Feb). Shorter cycle than weddings. | Under evaluation |
| Weddings need friction removal before volume push | Conversion already high on demos. Problem is follow-up, paperwork, payment path. Pushing more inquiries without fixing this creates busywork. | Under evaluation |
| Operations/workflows may require attention first | Current systems described as archaic/clunky. Extent unknown. May need assessment before or alongside revenue work. | **VALIDATED** — see bulletin board |
| Michael is thinking systematically about scale | Bulletin board (2026-01-02) shows heavy emphasis on team systems, scorecards, training, performance tracking — not just sales tactics. He's thinking like an operator building infrastructure. | Observed |

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | Why It Matters | Status |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Catering positioning + materials | Without clear offers and quoting materials, every inquiry requires custom work. Slows sales, creates inconsistency. | Not started — pending priority decision |
| Lead workflow (catering) | No defined path from prospect → close means leads leak. Need prospect list → outreach → follow-up → clean handoff to on-site team. | Not started — pending priority decision |
| Business Map | Shared reference for how money flows, who owns what, where things stick. | Scaffolded |
| Walkthrough-to-payment workflow (weddings) | High-ROI lever: removes friction in a channel with high close rate. Becomes more justified as incremental revenue increases operational load (systems are interconnected). May be worth pursuing early in lightweight form as proof of capability—a fast, custom improvement that demonstrates how targeted solutions convert directly into throughput. | Not started — pending priority decision |
| Marketing automation system | Replace marketing director function without redistributing workload to core team. Automated workflow (likely n8n + generative AI) handed to stakeholder who directs it. Salary redistributed to Elaynah/Aura. Time-sensitive — needs to be ready before/when marketing director exits. Derek builds. | Not started — technical build pending |
