## From Research (Legacy, Unverified)

These patterns appeared in reviews under prior ownership. Unknown if they persist:

- **Pricing surprises:** "Extra hour that they tell you is $750 turns out it's over 3000 after they add all the extras"
- **Verbal promises not documented:** Multiple reviews cite promises made on tours not honored
- **Vendor quality inconsistency:** DJ, bartender complaints
- **Facilities readiness:** Restrooms not stocked
- **Coordinator turnover disruption:** Planning became "challenging" when coordinators changed
- **No response to negative reviews:** $30K complaint on The Knot has no business response

Worth validating with Michael which (if any) still apply.
