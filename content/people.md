## Transitions

### Wedding Coordination
**Plan:** Team effort by Elena and Ayra in interim. Active hiring for dedicated Wedding Coordinator position. Structure allows for assistant coordinators to branch out across event types/verticals as business grows.

**Status:** Ad posted. Hiring in progress.

### Marketing Director
**Plan:** Function will be replaced by automated system, not redistributed as manual workload. Derek building marketing automation workflow (n8n + generative AI). System will be handed to a current stakeholder who directs it as an intelligent operator. Salary to be redistributed to Elena and Ayra.

**Status:** Technical build pending. Michael aware of general direction but not fully briefed on technical approach.

**Why this approach:** Marketing workflows are largely solved by automation + AI. Quality increases while workload becomes minimal. Stakeholder directs intent; system executes.
